## 🚀 Project Overview

SQL-Generator is a frontend-driven web app designed to simplify database interactions for non-technical users. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it translates user-friendly inputs into valid SQL queries — from creating users to managing permissions.

This project showcases:
- ✨ Intuitive UI/UX design
- 🧠 Rule-based SQL generation logic
- 🛠️ Clean, modular JavaScript architecture
- 📊 Real-world use cases like GRANT/REVOKE and CREATE USER

## 🌟 What Makes This Project Stand Out

This project is more than just a codebase — it's a demonstration of thoughtful design, practical problem-solving, and frontend craftsmanship:

### 🎨 User-Centric Design
- The interface is clean, responsive, and easy to navigate.
- Each form is purpose-built to guide users through SQL generation without confusion.
- Visual feedback and real-time query output make the experience interactive and educational.

### 🧠 Smart Logic Implementation
- JavaScript functions dynamically build SQL statements based on user input.
- The logic is modular and easy to extend — ideal for scaling to more complex queries.
- Input validation ensures users generate syntactically correct SQL.

### 🔧 Developer-Friendly Architecture
- HTML pages are organized by function (`index.html`, `create-user.html`, `grant-revoke.html`) for clarity.
- CSS is separated for maintainability and visual consistency.
- JavaScript is written with readability and reusability in mind.

### 📈 Real-World Relevance
- Covers practical SQL operations like user creation and permission management.
- Ideal for internal tools, admin panels, or educational platforms.
- Can be easily integrated with backend systems or enhanced with AI/NLP.

## 🧪 How It Works

```js
// Example: Generate CREATE USER SQL
const username = document.getElementById("username").value;
const password = document.getElementById("password").value;
const sql = `CREATE USER '${username}' IDENTIFIED BY '${password}';`;
```
